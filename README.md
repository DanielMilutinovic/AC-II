# S12XE-Calculator
A scientific, programmable RPN calculator using the NXP 9S12XEP100  microcontroller.
Inspired by Dirk Heisswolf's AriCalculator project (see https://hotwolf.github.io/AriCalculator/), this project will document the hardware and assembly language software of the prototype for a hand-held scientific, programmable RPN calculator.
