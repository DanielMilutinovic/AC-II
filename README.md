# S12XE-Calculator
A scientific, programmable calculator using the NXP 9S12XEP100  microcontroller.
Inspired by Dirk Heisswolf's AriCalculator project (see https://hotwolf.github.io/AriCalculator/), this project will document the hardware and assembly language software of the prototype for a hand-held scientific, programmable calculator.
Files in this project will include:
1) NXP 9S12XEP100 datasheet (added)
2) S12XE-Calculator: Part 1 - Getting Started (not yet added - coming soon) 
3) S12XE-Calculator: Part 2 - interfacing the NXP DEVKIT-S12XE to an ST7565 display (not yet added)    
4) S12XE-Calculator: Part 3 - interfacing the NXP DEVKIT-S12XE to a matrix keypad featuring 44 keys (not yet added) 
5) S12XE-Calculator: Part 4 - the command line and stack (not yet added) 
6) S12XE-Calculator: Part 5 - the functions +,-,*,/ (not yet added)
7) S12XE-Calculator: Part 6 - the algebraic and transcendental functions (not yet added)
8) S12XE-Calculator: Part 7 - programmability (not yet added)
