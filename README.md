# AriCalculator-II
A programmable, scientific and statistical RPN calculator using the NXP 9S12XEP100  microcontroller.
Inspired by Dirk Heisswolf's AriCalculator project (see https://hotwolf.github.io/AriCalculator/), this project will document the hardware and assembly language software for the prototype of a hand-held programmable, scientific and statistical RPN calculator.
Files in this project include:
1) AriCalculator-II book (read this first)
2) DEVKIT-S12XE Quick Start Guide
3) NXP 9S12XEP100 datasheet 
4) LED.asm
