# S12XE-Calculator
A scientific, programmable calculator using the NXP 9S12XEP100  microcontroller.
Inspired by the AriCalculator project by Dirk Heisswolf (see https://hotwolf.github.io/AriCalculator/), this project will document the hardware and assembly language software used to develop a prototype of a hand-held scientific, programmable calculator.
Files in this project include:
1) NXP 9S12XEP100 datasheet
2) S12XE-Calculator Introduction, giving an overview of the project (coming soon) 
3) S12XE-Calculator Part 1, giving information on interfacing the NXP DEVKIT-S12XE to an ST7565 display (coming soon)
