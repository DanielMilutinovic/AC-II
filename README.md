# S12XE-Calculator
A scientific, programmable calculator using the NXP 9S12XEP100  microcontroller.
Inspired by the AriCalculator project by Dirk Heisswolf (see https://hotwolf.github.io/AriCalculator/), this project will document the hardware and assembly language software used to develop a prototype of a hand-held scientific, programmable calculator.
Files in this project will include:
1) NXP 9S12XEP100 datasheet
2) S12XE-Calculator Introduction, giving an overview of the project (coming soon) 
3) S12XE-Calculator Part 1 - interfacing the NXP DEVKIT-S12XE to an ST7565 display (coming soon)  
4) S12XE-Calculator Part 2 - interfacing the NXP DEVKIT-S12XE to a matrix keypad featuring 44 keys (coming soon) 
5) S12XE-Calculator Part 3 - the command line and stack 
6) S12XE-Calculator Part 4 - the functions +,-,*,/
7) S12XE-Calculator Part 5 - the algebraic and transcendental functions
8) S12XE-Calculator Part 6 - writing programs on the calculator
